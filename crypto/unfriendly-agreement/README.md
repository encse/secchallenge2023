# Unfriendly Agreement

Alice and Bob are roommates. They hate each other with a passion but still need to sign documents together. They heard the buzz in the crypto scene about adaptor signatures and atomic swaps and decided to hop on the hype train and use that protocol. Sadly Bob fluked his Crypto 101 course and doesn't have a clue about how to recover the signature Alice prepared. Can you help him? Big money is on the line!
