We iterated through each character of the flag, we appended a 10 digit long binary number (only containing 0s and 1s) to this character, then we randomly calculated the resulting 11 character long strings' hash choosing one from the following hash algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512. Give me the flag!
