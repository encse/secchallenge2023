# Show me D vault

Your friend - a self proclaimed inventor, entrepreneur and full-stack developer - created a new, super secure cloud-based storage solution called `Vault 3023`.

He said it is called `Vault 3023`, because `"This revolutionary authentication solution requires so high IQ to open it, that you have to be as smart as people living in 3023."`. I asked him whether this authentication method has any vulnerabilities, but he rolled his eyes and told me it is `military grade secure`. Gosh, I hate that douche.

Anyways, lets take a look at this vault for ourselves. He said something about a special keyboard required to enter the password for the vault. We went ahead for you and - being unaware of the utilized protocol - created a capture with a logic analizer while he was entering his password on this special keyboard.

You can access the vault site at https://vault3023.secchallenge.crysys.hu

Good luck!

**NOTE:** This is **NOT** a web challenge.
