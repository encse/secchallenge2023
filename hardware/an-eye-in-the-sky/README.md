# An eye in the SKy

We recieved a capture file from an IT Sec student at BUTE. They believe there is an `Unmanned Aerial Vehicle` (UAV) flying around the university. They could see the hungarian flag on its tailfin - so there is no cause for alarm -, but they would like to get more information about its current objective if possible.

They used a high-gain antenna to capture a signal from the UAV, transmitted on - one of the most commonly used, license free ISM radio band - 433.92 MHz. We believe the UAV utilizes some sort of `line code` during transmission.
