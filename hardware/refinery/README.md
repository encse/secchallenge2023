# Refinery

The oil refinery has been hacked and the automatic control logic is not working. The technicians are already working on the restoration, but the following volumes should be achieved at least by tomorrow's opening:
```
gas >= 750G
E5 gasoline >= 400G
E10 gasoline >= 400G
kerosene >= 200G
diesel >= 300G.
```

Hack into the refinery system and manually control the PLCs to achieve the goal within 400 minutes (1min=3s in the game).
