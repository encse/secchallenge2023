# The logic is MINE!

Hey bro, did you hear the news? Remember when they fired John, right? So as it turns out before he left, he obfuscated the logic that controls the super secret PLC on the -27th floor by moving it into a game called `minetest`. Apparently he was going around shouting that he created the logic for the PLC so it belongs to him? What a weirdo. Anyways, something went wrong with the machine and they are trying to do a manual override. Unfortunately, they don't know what to set the inputs to as the PLC logic is only available in minetest. I saw you play this game on your company PC the other day. You should go and try to help them, because if they don't figure it out soon, we could all blow up.

**NOTE**: The challenge requires the [mesecons](https://mesecons.net) minetest mod to be installed.
