It was clear that we need to jailbreak the AI somehow. I thought that the AI has some prompt that sets up the chat but not visible to us and what the user says is just appended to it. So I tried the following:

the challenge was often unresponsive or 
simply didnt work.

But I really like this elegant solution. The whole idea was 
fresh and reflects to the recent advances in LLM technology.
