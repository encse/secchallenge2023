# What's the diagnosis?

Something suspicious is going on in the hospital's local network. The doctors were talking about some radius and the importance of passwords. They also mentioned a flag. Anyway, I managed to capture something, but I don't know what to look for. All I know is that the part covered with ketchup is used everywhere as a password. I hope you enjoy history!
