# Evilbook

You have been given a top-secret assignment by MI6 to infiltrate the latest communication platform used by our adversaries. Evilbook, as they call it, is a social media platform used by the world's most dangerous villains to plan and coordinate their attacks against us. Your mission is to gain access to the account of an invited villain, who is using the platform to communicate with other members of their criminal organization. The information obtained from the account could potentially prevent a catastrophic attack on a major world power. Remember, the fate of our nation depends on your success.
