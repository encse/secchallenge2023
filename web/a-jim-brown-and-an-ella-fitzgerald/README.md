# A Jim Brown and an Ella Fitzgerald

Night Fox, you've been tasked with the ultimate challenge: breaking into Terry Benedict's heavily guarded bank vault and making off with the contents undetected. You'll need to use all of your skills and expertise to bypass the bank's sophisticated security systems, crack the vault's combination code, and get in and out without a trace. You'll be working alone, but don't let that stop you. With the right strategy and a little bit of luck, you just might pull off the greatest heist in history. Do you have what it takes to outsmart Benedict and get away with the loot?
