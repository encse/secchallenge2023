# BYOV

I implemented a small, fun game called Nim; but I made sure that there isn't any vulnerability, by starting the source code with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. But then I decided to give you a chance: you have to bring your own vulnerability!

But there is a catch: you cannot just bring any vulnerability, and put it in there; you can only flip a single bit in the binary.
